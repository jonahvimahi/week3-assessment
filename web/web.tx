The internet is what the web uses to get information and data to anywhere in the world. Everything is connected to the web in a way that actually looks like a web lol. Everything needs to be connected and it can either be through an ethernet connection or through a wireless connection. In order to get that wireless connection to the internet, routers are used. All routers are connected which makes all computers connected when using that wireless connection or wired connection. Internet service providers have special routers that can reach the ones we use everyday. The internet service providers allow us to all connect to the internet.

When we click on a link we are clicking on words but our computers recognize them as ip addresses and they use that ip and go look for what that ip address means so they go through different caches on the computer or the modem and if they are unable to find anything through there they go to the isp and if its not there they can search the vast interweb and see if they can find it there. Through this process it is getting whatever it can from those places then puts it on your screen.
